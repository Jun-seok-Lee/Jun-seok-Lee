Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm one of undergraduate dreaming of contributing open source community.

When working in NANUS start-up, I became interested in AI including NLP.

However, there were a lot of limits to solely implement an application from scratch despite of demo version.

After the frustration, I hoped someone taught me as an assistant.

I believe that AI could serve as an assistant around us.
