Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am an undergraduate who dreams of contributing to the open-source community.

During my time at the NANUS startup, I developed an interest in AI including NLP.

However, I encounterd numerous challenges in developing an application from scracth, even a demo version.

This experience led me to wish for guidance from an assistant.

I believe that AI has the potential to serve as a helpful assistant in our daily lives.

## Research Interests

AGI, Multi-modality
